      <h1>Dogs or Cats?</h1>

      <h2>What kind of person are you?</h2>

      <p>
        The world is made up of three types of people: Cat people; dog people; &
        boring people.
      </p>

      <p>Why do you think you have a preference for one over the over?</p>

        <h3>Dogs</h3>

        <p>
          The dog's story is inexorably linked with the human's. Dogs are dogs,
          and not wolves, purely because of human tampering. They were made by
          us to fit us. The same is true of almonds, but almonds don't play
          fetch. We took, and take, the cute ones, the sweet ones, the ones we
          like the best and mold them and their offspring, often to the
          detriment of their health, into our perfect companions. And that they
          are.

        <h3>Cats</h3>

        <p>
          Cats are graceful, clumsy, silky soft with sharp edges, softly glowing
          eyes in the dark, purring, kneading balls of fur curled up closely
          against your body warmth, intellegent, annoying, funny, great
          conversationalists with comments about many things, and intriguing
          little creatures who display many emotions including affection, even
          love for their guardians.
